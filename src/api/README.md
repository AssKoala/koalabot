# KoalaBot API
## Overview
The KoalaBot API is meant to make it easy to add custom slash commands to the bot.

The goal is to do what it does well and easily.  What it doesn't do, it doesn't even attempt to do.

## API Overview
The API is split into a few classes.  In general, a custom command simply needs to use the _DiscordBotCommand_ class to do what they want to do.
